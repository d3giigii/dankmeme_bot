Bot should run until it reaches a post it has already seen. 
    Add title and URL of each post to a file. If that combination already exists, stop. 
        This log file should be in reverse chronological order i.e. latest first. 
        Only works if parsing through posts in a chronological order. 

Bot should not overwrite a file if it wants to save an image with the same name. 

Bot should use a re.sub() to replace special chars instead of multiple .replace() calls.
